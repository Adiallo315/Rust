# <p align="center">Password Generator and MD5 Hash Cracker in Rust</p>

This project includes a command-line password generator and MD5 hash cracker written in Rust. It allows generating secure passwords with options to specify length, number of passwords to generate, and evaluating the generated passwords' security. Additionally, it includes functionality to crack MD5 hashed passwords.

## üßê Key Features

- Random password generation with specified length.
- Option to generate multiple passwords at once.
- Evaluation of generated password security.
- MD5 hash cracking functionality.
- Saving generated passwords to a file with additional information.

## Prerequisites

- Rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Docker

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:Adiallo315/Rust.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd generateur_mdp
   ```

3. run docker build:

   ```sh
   docker build -t rust .
   ```

   ```sh
   docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app rust
   ```

4. Compile the project:
   ```sh
   cargo build
   ```

## Contents

- A src folder containing main.rs, which is the main program file.

- A .gitignore file to exclude the target directory.
- Cargo.lock file generated by Cargo, Rust's package and build manager, ensuring deterministic builds.

- Cargo.toml file used by Cargo to define project metadata, dependencies, build configurations, and other Rust project settings.

- README.md file describing the repository and explaining how to use the program.

- generated_password.txt, a text file to store all generated passwords.

## üõ†Ô∏èUsage

To run the password generator, use the following command:

```sh
  cargo run
```

You will be prompted to enter the password length and the number of passwords to generate. Afterwards, you will have the option to save the generated passwords to a file.
